- Replaced `fasthttp.Client` with standard `net/http.Client` in auth module
- Implemented zero-copy streaming with immediate data flushing
- Added concurrent-safe HTTP request processing
- Optimized memory usage in streaming scenarios

### üìä Performance
- **First-token latency**: Reduced from ~2-3 seconds to near-zero
- **JSON processing**: 2-5x faster with bytedance/sonic
- **Streaming throughput**: Significantly improved real-time data delivery
- **Memory efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint through better buffer management

### üõ†Ô∏è Architecture
- Clean separation between streaming and non-streaming request flows
- Modular StreamParser for handling partial EventStream data
- Improved request/response conversion layer
- Better middleware stack with gin framework

### üßπ Cleanup
- Removed all fasthttp dependencies
- Cleaned up unused imports and dependencies
- Streamlined go.mod with only essential dependencies

### üìö Documentation
- Updated README.md with new architecture information
- Added streaming examples and performance notes
- Updated CLAUDE.md with v2.0.0 implementation details
- Added comprehensive version history

### üîÑ Migration Guide
For users upgrading from v1.x.x:
- No API breaking changes for end users
- All existing curl commands and client integrations continue to work
- Improved streaming performance is automatic
- Server startup commands remain the same

### Dependencies
